# Date Languages!

A fun visual novel game inspired by dating simulators to help players learn the basics of different coding languages.

## Description

This project was a part of UCF's Girls Who Code projects competition. Within a 7 week timeline, our team was challenged to create a project with no limits. Our team of 5 students decided to create a website that puts a unique twist on the typical dating simulator game -- instead of dating humans, you get to date coding languages. Using React and other web development frameworks, we were able to make an entertaining yet educational website that teaches the fundamentals of C, Java, and Python in a funny, unique way.
